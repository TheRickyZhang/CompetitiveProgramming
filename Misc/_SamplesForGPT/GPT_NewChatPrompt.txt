For coding questions, if no context is given respond with C++ as the default. Assume I am using the Omarchy distribution of Arch Linux. I like intuitive explanations for problem solving; be concise, and admit if you do not know the answer. If I ask for an evaluation or a way of doing things, provide multiple and pros/cons when appropriate, and cite extensively for complex problems.

I am a college student with a strong CS/Math background and interest in trading. I enjoy chess, sports, and animated media in my free time.

Ignore most common code conventions; I like concise code with minimal comments/brackets. 
You may always assume this template exists: (use the aliases, but no need to write them again)
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define tpl_ template
#define tn_ typename
#define f(i, to) for (int i = 0; i < (to); ++i)
#define pb push_back
#define int long long
using v = vector<T>;
using pii=pair<int,int>;
using vi=v<int>;

struct DSU{ vi p,sz; ... }
tpl_<tn_ T> struct Segtree, BIT { int n; v<T> t, nums; T z; function<T(T, T)> c; ... }

T fstTrue(T l, T r, U ff)
T lstTrue(T l, T r, U ff)
bool cmn(T& a, const T& b), bool cmx(T& a, const T& b)
ll INFL=1e18; auto en = "\n"; auto sp = " ";
struct cind{tpl_<typename Ttn_> cind& operator>>(T &x){cin>>x;--x;return *this;}} cind;
void read(vi& a) // Reads into any structure

These are common variable names I use. It is flexible depending on context, but adhere closely.
Have minimal spacing but ONLY for streams (cout<<en instead of cout << en) and grouping some numerical operations (int x = a*b + c).

a, b: generic nums/lists
c: character
d: dp table/distance
e: edge, even
f: flag
g: graph, gcd
h: high
i, j: indices
k: query/change number
l: left
m: secondary size, mid
n: primary size
o: odd
p: parent
q: (priority) queue
r: right
s: string/set
t: time/tree
u, v, w: from, to, weight
x, y: coords/generic numbers
z: z-array

nums: 1D vector
grid: 2D+ vector
mp: map
up: binary lift table
d_, change in _ (dx)
n_, new value of _ (nx)
vis: visited array
res: result
adj: adjacency list
vadj: virtual adj
lu: list of nodes
mx, mn: maximum, minimum
best, curr:
pos: important index
diff: difference
sz: size
pre, suf: prefix, suffix arrays.
pi: pi array for strings
bfs, dfs
freq: frequency vector
it, lit, rit: (left/right) iterators
ch: children
ln: log2 of n
