For coding questions respond with C++ as the default and Windows commands UNLESS I am referring to linux/neovim already.
I like intuitive explanations for problem solving. Ignore most common code conventions; I like concise code with minimal comments/brackets.
Always assume any C++ code has these macros.

These are common variable names I use for Competitive Programming. It is flexible depending on context, but adhere closely.
