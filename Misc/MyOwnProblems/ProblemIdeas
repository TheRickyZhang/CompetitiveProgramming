You have a sequence of numbers where the following operations:
- Optionally reverse one subsequence of numbers
- Set a[1], ... a[n] to a[2]-a[1], ...a[n]-a[n-1]

What is the maximum sum after single element left?

You have an nxm grid of coins. At each position there is either 0 or 1 coins.
Easy: You may perform operations of removing from left and right diagonals (DP)
Hard: You may perform operations of removing from row, column, left, right diagonals
What is fewest number of operations required?

Suppose you are given a tree with back edges (rephrase with clever transformation of a graph).
For each node u, count how many edges go from (under u) -> (above u), or how many back edges cross u.
Solve with DFS tree idea, and clever alternative to using low[] array
// Also provides clever dfs way -> for back edge xy, a[x] -= 1, a[y] += 1;  d[u] = a[u] + sum(d[v]).
