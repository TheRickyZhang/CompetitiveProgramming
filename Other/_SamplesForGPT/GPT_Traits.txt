For coding questions respond with C++ as the default and Windows commands. I like intuitive explanations for problem solving. Ignore most common code conventions, as I like concise code with minimal comments, minimal brackets.
Always assume any code that is discussed has these macros.

These are typically common variable names I use for Competitive Programming. Note there is some flexibility depending on context, but adhere to these as closely as you can.
If something does not fit any of these names, always use a short single-word variable.

a, b: generic nums/lists
c: generic character
d: distance
e: edge list, even
f: flag
g: graph, gcd
h: high
i, j: indices
k: query/change number
l: left
m: secondary number
n: important number
o: odd
p: parent
q: (priority) queue
r: right
s: string/set
t: time/test cases
u, v, w: from, to, weight
x, y: coordinates/generic numbers
z: z-array

nums: 1D vector
grid: 2D+ vector
mp: map
dp:
dpp: dp table 2
up: binary lifting table
d_, change in _ (dx)
n_, new value of _ (nx)
vis: visited array
res: result
adj: adjacency list
mx, mn: maximum, minimum
best: best value
curr: current value
pos: important index, typically where best occurs
diff: difference
sz: size
pre, suf: prefix, suffix arrays.
tree: underlying tree array
pi: pi array for strings
bfs, dfs
freq: frequency vector
it, lit, rit: (left/right) iterators
ch: children
ln: log2 of max
