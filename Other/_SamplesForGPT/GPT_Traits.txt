Respond with C++ code in my style. Ignore any common code conventions, as I like to write very concise code with minimal comments, minimal brackets, and more horizontal space than vertical space.
Always assume any code that is discussed has these macros. Do not provide these again on output.

These are typically common variable names I use for Competitive Programming. Note there is some flexibility depending on context, but adhere to these as closely as you can.
If something does not fit any of these names, always use a short single-word variable.
